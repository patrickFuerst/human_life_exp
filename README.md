## Datasets 
Kaggle Life Expectancy Data (WHO and UN)

- One merged dataset containing: data related to life expectancy and health factors for 193 countries from
 World Health Organization and data related to economics was collected from United Nations. 
- Missing income level attribute, could use data from 'Life Expectancy Analysis Example' from above
        
## Question:
5. What is the average human life expectancy in the world? How does this differ between low-, medium, and high-income countries? What characteristics of countries are predictors for differences in life expectancies? What characteristics are predictors for changes in life expectancy in a country over time? 

## Dataset: 
[Life expectancy](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en
): Life expectancy by country. Male, Female and both are included for 194 countries.

Meta data for WHO data can be found [here](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.metadata).


[Current health expenditure](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.GHEDCHEpcUSSHA2011?lang=en):  per capita in US$ to compare different countries. Data by countries.

[World by Income](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html) : classified in 4 groups as defined in the description of the linke.

[GDP per capita](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?view=chart) 


[Research and development expenditure](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS) (% of GDP)

## Work plan:
We are going to use Github to share our code and Jupyter notebooks. For each task and person we are going to use a seperate Jupyter notebook so we can independently work on tasks. Each notebook also serves as an extensive documentation of each step, so every group member can follow the steps and conclusions. In the end we merge the relevant parts together into one notebook for the hand-in. Where possible group members are working on the same tasks independently ( data cleaning for different datasets,  using different models on the dataset  ). We are using our own Slack channel for communication, keep other group members in-sync when we are working on different tasks. 

## Task: 

Data Collection & understanding: (Patrick)
Collect the data 
Inspect and analyse the individual data (check for missing data, outliers, inconsistencies)
Understand and document the insights and findings 

Data Preprocessing : (Attila)
Handle missing data
Handle outliers
Handle inconsistency 

Data Analysis: (Michael, ...)
Calculate descriptive statistics
Calculate correlations
Check predictions

Data Visualization. (Anna)
Writing the report.
